				<center><p>Circy's Info:</p></center><br>
				 Head of the bad incorporation! A bunny that is possibly a vigilante?? Ring any bells? Danger! Known for his ruthless plans to “take risks” for the “aid of others” as quoted by Swirls himself! On top of being head, he is in charge of making sure these people do their harmful jobs in the name of “good.” We’ve also heard he’s very oblivious to people’s inputs and has a bad temper! Do not join this team if you don’t want to fall victim!

				Twin of Pop. Suspected to be a conmouse, thus being unreliable! Known for his snarkily confident attitude, he’s not very welcoming sounding! He is a planner of those they need to take relentless action over for the “good” of others!

				<center><p>Duke's Info:</p></center><br>
				 From what we hear, he is a lazy horse, only in it for the money and rarely communicates? What a downer! He’s supposedly a “monitoring figure” who walks all high and mighty in front of new recruits! It can be a very intimidating experience, we do not recommend it! He is also in charge of city events that help gain the publicity and a “good view” on their incorporation!

				They’re an easily annoyed cat that doesn’t like other people’s ideas! Known for being relatively quiet but still snappy. They’re an extra planner that works hand in hand with Circy and seems to be very secretive of their planning. One to try to persuade you through silence to join their team. Don’t let their convincing silence fool you!
