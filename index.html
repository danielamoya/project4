				Fizzy is an incorporation, started through breaking off ties with STAR Inc. Now, partners of MOON Inc. who do gentle methods compared to that of Swirls through striking deals with those who are affected to see whether they would be okay with such a feat. or not. This group is much better compared to that of Swirls as they are not suspected of such bad things, no matter what “good” they do. This is the right way to go! Choose to join Fizzy Inc. They look forward to new recruits! Click on more pages to see why it's the way to go!

				Swirls is a incorporation, believed to have been a vigilante group whomst did anything for their beliefs in their belief of justice; there is no evidence as of now of such an event, but such a suspected event still remains to be suspected. Swirls Inc. is a system of many branches that takes advantage over others to take a chance at saving more, a ruthless system. As of now, they are looking for more recruits to join this system and it is completely disgusting! Their way of what they do is completely unnecessary when Fizzy Inc. is already doing their job!
