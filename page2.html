				Hi!! I’m Fizzy and I’m the head of Fizzy Inc. I made this company as our world struggles with many issues from as little as shard dust cleaning to as big as comet crashes; I wanted to help clean up our problems and preserve our lives! I used to be a traffic guard for children and look forward to even our youngest recruits! It is okay if you don’t “have the experience” I’ll be glad to assist you along the way, unlike Swirls who takes advantage on your team! And I should know, we used to work together! He’s a crooked bunny! I am in charge of keeping everyone in check, happy, and available. I also take hold in big ceremonious events like the falling star festival.
